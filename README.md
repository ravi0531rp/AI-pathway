## Topics

* **Languages (Python, C++, Golang, System Design)**  
  Python for ML, data science, scripting, and rapid prototyping; C++ for performance-critical systems, memory management, and understanding low-level execution; Golang for building scalable, concurrent backend services. System Design covers designing large-scale, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems including ML platforms, data pipelines, and real-time services.

* **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**  
  Core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, graph algorithms). Focus on problem-solving, time and space complexity analysis, and writing efficient, interview-ready, and production-quality solutions.

* **Mathematics (Calculus, Stats & Probability, Linear Algebra, Optimizations)**  
  Calculus for gradients, partial derivatives, and backpropagation; linear algebra for vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, and transformations; probability and statistics for distributions, hypothesis testing, and uncertainty modeling; optimization techniques such as gradient descent, convex optimization, and constrained optimization.

* **Databases (Relational, NoSQL, Graph)**  
  Relational databases (SQL, joins, indexing, normalization, transactions), NoSQL systems (key-value, document, columnar stores) for scalability and flexibility, and graph databases for relationship-heavy data and network-based queries.

* **APIs and Microservices (Architecture Design, Cloud, APIs)**  
  REST and gRPC API design, microservices architecture, service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Cloud-native design using AWS/GCP/Azure, scalable deployment of ML services, and secure API integration.

* **Data Science & Engineering (Core DS and DE)**  
  Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, ETL pipelines, batch and streaming systems, data warehousing, and building reliable data infrastructure that supports analytics and ML workloads.

* **Machine Learning (Core ML, Unsupervised, Recommender Systems, MLOps, Anomaly Detection)**  
  Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, feature selection, model evaluation, recommender systems, anomaly detection techniques, and MLOps practices including model versioning, monitoring, deployment, and retraining.

* **Deep Learning (Core DL, Frameworks, Advanced)**  
  Neural network fundamentals, backpropagation, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and attention mechanisms. Hands-on work with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, along with advanced topics such as optimization tricks, regularization, and large-scale training.

* **Computer Vision (Traditional Image Processing + Modern DL-based)**  
  Classical techniques like filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction, combined with modern deep learning approaches for image classification, object detection, segmentation, and video understanding.

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP, Projects)**  
  Text preprocessing, embeddings, sequence models, transformers, language models, and NLP pipelines. Practical projects involving text classification, information extraction, search, summarization, and conversational systems.

* **Sequence Modelling (Time Series Data)**  
  Time series analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, ARIMA-style models, RNNs/LSTMs, temporal transformers, and handling sequential dependencies in real-world data.

* **Reinforcement Learning (Foundations and Advanced RL + Heuristics AI)**  
  Markov Decision Processes, value-based and policy-based methods, Q-learning, policy gradients, actor-critic methods, advanced RL techniques, and heuristic-based AI approaches for decision-making problems.

* **Big Data (PySpark, Hadoop, HDFS, etc.)**  
  Distributed data processing concepts, Spark (RDDs, DataFrames, SQL), Hadoop ecosystem, HDFS, batch vs streaming workloads, and designing scalable data processing pipelines.

* **Data Analytics (Pandas, Visualization)**  
  Exploratory and descriptive analytics using Pandas, NumPy, SQL, and visualization tools. Creating dashboards, reports, and visual narratives to communicate insights effectively.

* **DevOps (Version Control, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes)**  
  Git-based workflows, CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, orchestration using Kubernetes, infrastructure as code, monitoring, logging, and deploying ML and data systems reliably.

* **Generative AI – Practical (Fine-tuning, Training, RAG, Embeddings, Agents)**  
  Hands-on work with generative models: fine-tuning LLMs, prompt engineering, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent-based systems, and building real-world GenAI applications.

* **Generative AI – Theoretical (Model Architectures, Training Paradigms)**  
  Deep understanding of transformer architectures, diffusion models, training objectives, scaling laws, alignment techniques, and the theoretical foundations behind modern generative models.
